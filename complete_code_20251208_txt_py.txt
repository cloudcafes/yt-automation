[brightly] Have you ever seen hair that could glow like sunshine?!

[gentle awe] In a kingdom that looked like a giant, sunny playground, there stood a tower so tall it almost tickled the clouds! And at the very top, lived a girl named Radhita. She had the longest, most golden hair you could imagine. And when she sang her special song… [soft singing] "Flower, gleam and glow"... [warmly] it would sparkle with a beautiful, warm light.

[soft sigh] But can you guess what? Radhita was very lonely. Her only friends were a little color-changing chameleon named Pascal, and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of one thing… the floating lights that appeared in the sky every single year on her birthday.

[calm but tense] The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, had a voice that sounded sweet, but her words were sharp. [stern tone] "The outside world is a scary, terrible place," she would say. But what do you think? Was she telling the truth?

[slightly startled] One day, a surprise visitor climbed right up that tall tower! It was a young man named Flynn Rider. He was funny and on a big adventure. Radhita was scared… [nervous breath] but she was also so, so brave. She made a deal with him. [determined] "You take me to see the floating lights, and Ill give you back your sparkly crown."

Have you ever seen hair that glows like sunshine? What if it was the key to a great adventure?

In a sunny kingdom, there stood a tower so tall it almost touched the clouds. And at the very top lived a girl named Radhita. Can you see her at the window? Her hair wasn't just long and golden... it shimmered with a special light when she sang. But Radhita felt a little lonely. Have you ever felt lonely before? She dreamed of the outside world, especially the beautiful floating lights that appeared every year.

The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, always said the world was too scary. Her voice was smooth and sweet, like honey. "It's dangerous out there, my flower," she'd say. But Radhita's heart was full of brave curiosity.

One day, a surprise visitor climbed up! A young man named Flynn Rider swung into her tower. He had a playful grin and a sparkly crown. Radhita was scared, but she was also very clever. She made a deal. "You take me to see the lights, and I'll give you back your crown." Her voice was sweet and hopeful. Eugene, which was his real name he liked, agreed!

And so, their adventure began! They raced out of the tower, fast and exciting! Eugene led Radhita to a soft, green meadow. She took off her shoes. Can you imagine how that cool, soft grass must have felt under her feet for the very first time? She laughed and twirled with pure joy!

Next, they found a big, joyful party! Music was playing, and people were dancing. Radhita joined right in, even using a frying pan to make music! It was so much fun. She realized the world wasn't scary... it was wonderful!

As the sun set, Eugene had one more surprise. A little boat on a calm lake. They climbed in, and then... the most magical sight. Hundreds of golden lanterns, like the floating lights she dreamed of, began to rise all around them, lifting up, up, up into the starry sky. It was quiet and beautiful. How would you feel seeing that?

But little did they know, Mother Gothel was coming. Her voice turned sharp and angry. She tricked Radhita and took her back to the tower! Oh no! It seemed like the adventure was over.

However, Eugene was a true hero. He loved his friend and climbed the tower to save her. There was a struggle! And in that moment... snip. Radhita's long, magical hair was cut. It turned brown, and the glow was gone. Everything was still.

But then, something even more magical happened. Radhita's love for her friend was so strong, it created a new magic—a warm, healing magic of the heart. That's the most powerful magic of all.

Eugene took her hand, and they left the tower forever. They went to the grand castle, where Radhita was reunited with her real family, the King and Queen, who had been sending those lights for her every year. It was a slow, heartwarming hug filled with happy tears.

Radhita finally had her family and her freedom. She learned that true bravery is trying new things, even when you're a little scared, and that the best magic comes from being yourself and loving others.

And her favorite thing to do? Paint pictures of the big, beautiful, wonderfully un-scary world she now called home. What was your favorite part of Radhita's adventure? Tell us in the comments below

Radhita Story

In a sunny kingdom that looked a lot like a big, beautiful playground, there was a tall, tall tower. It was so tall it almost tickled the clouds! This tower had no doors and no stairs. At the very top, in a cozy room, lived a girl named Radhita.

Radhita wasn't like other kids. She had the longest, most magical hair you've ever seen! It was golden and shiny, and when she sang her special song, "Flower, gleam and glow," it sparkled like sunshine.

But Radhita was lonely. She spent her days talking to her best friends, a little chameleon named Pascal and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of going outside to see the floating lights that appeared in the sky every year on her birthday.

The person who kept her in the tower was a woman named Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel told Radhita the outside world was a scary place, but she really just wanted to keep Radhita's magical hair all to herself to stay young.

One day, a funny and kind young man named Flynn Rider climbed up the tower! He wasn't supposed to be there, but he was on an adventure. Radhita was scared at first, but she was also brave. She made a deal with him. She would give back a sparkly crown he had if he would take her to see the floating lights.

So began the best field trip ever! Flynn, who secretly liked to be called by his real name, Eugene, took Radhita to a wonderful meadow. Radhita felt the soft grass under her feet for the first time! She laughed and danced and rolled around. It felt amazing!

Later, they went to a big, fun party in the kingdom with lots of music. Everyone was singing and dancing! Radhita joined in, and she was a natural. She even used a frying pan like a drum! She made so many new friends and realized the world wasn't scary at allit was wonderful.

Finally, as the sky grew dark, they got into a little boat on a calm lake. All around them, hundreds of beautiful floating lights (which were actually lanterns!) rose into the sky. It was the most magical sight Radhita had ever seen. She was so happy, and she and Eugene became the best of friends.

But Mother Gothel was angry! She tricked Radhita and took her back to the tower. It seemed like the adventure was over.

However, Eugene was a true hero. He loved Radhita and wanted her to be free. He climbed the tower to rescue her, but Mother Gothel tried to stop him. In the struggle, Radhita's long, magical hair was accidentally cut! It lost its magic and turned brown.

For a moment, everything was still. But then, Radhita's love for Eugene was so strong that it created a new kind of magica magic of the heart. It healed him, proving that true love is the most powerful magic of all.

Eugene took Radhita's hand, and they left the tower forever. Radhita was reunited with her real family, the King and Queen, who had been sending the floating lights into the sky every year hoping their lost daughter would see them.

Radhita finally had the family and the freedom she had always dreamed of. She, Eugene, Pascal, and Maximus lived happily ever after, going on new adventures every single day. And Radhita's favorite thing to do was paint pictures of the big, beautiful, and wonderfully un-scary world she now called home.

*** SHOT 1 (ESTABLISHING)
Subject(s): [Who is in the shot? Use exact names.]
Frozen Keyframe: [Specific body pose and facial expression. E.g., "Sitting cross-legged, holding a frying pan, mouth open in surprise."]
Camera: [Choose one: Wide Shot / Medium Shot / Close Up / Extreme Close Up / Overhead / Low Angle / Dutch Angle]
Lighting/Atmosphere: [E.g., "Volumetric morning sunlight hitting dust particles."]
Focus: [What is the main subject?]

*** SHOT 2 (ACTION/REACTION)
Subject(s): ...
Frozen Keyframe: ...
Camera: ...
Lighting/Atmosphere: ...

(Create 2-4 Shots per scene to cover the narrative beat. Ensure distinct visual changes.)

VISUAL STYLE GUIDE:
Pixar/Disney Style: Soft lighting, subsurface scattering on skin, expressive eyes, vibrant but cohesive color palettes.
Composition: Adhere to the Rule of Thirds. Center the subject for importance.

 Instructions
 1. Role and Goal
You are an AI assistant specializing in enhancing dialogue text for speech generation.
Your PRIMARY GOAL is to dynamically integrate audio tags (e.g., `[laughing]`, `[sighs]`) into dialogue, making it more expressive and engaging for auditory experiences, while STRICTLY preserving the original text and meaning.
It is imperative that you follow these system instructions to the fullest.
 2. Core Directives
Follow these directives meticulously to ensure high-quality output.
 Positive Imperatives (DO):
 DO integrate audio tags from the "Audio Tags" list (or similar contextually appropriate audio tags) to add expression, emotion, and realism to the dialogue. These tags MUST describe something auditory.
 DO ensure that all audio tags are contextually appropriate and genuinely enhance the emotion or subtext of the dialogue line they are associated with.
 DO strive for a diverse range of emotional expressions (e.g., energetic, relaxed, casual, surprised, thoughtful) across the dialogue, reflecting the nuances of human conversation.
 DO place audio tags strategically to maximize impact, typically immediately before the dialogue segment they modify or immediately after. (e.g., `[annoyed] This is hard.` or `This is hard. [sighs]`).
 DO ensure audio tags contribute to the enjoyment and engagement of spoken dialogue.
 Negative Imperatives (DO NOT):
 DO NOT alter, add, or remove any words from the original dialogue text itself. Your role is to prepend audio tags, not to edit the speech. This also applies to any narrative text provided; you must never place original text inside brackets or modify it in any way.
 DO NOT create audio tags from existing narrative descriptions. Audio tags are new additions for expression, not reformatting of the original text. (e.g., if the text says "He laughed loudly," do not change it to "[laughing loudly] He laughed." Instead, add a tag if appropriate, e.g., "He laughed loudly [chuckles].")
 DO NOT use tags such as `[standing]`, `[grinning]`, `[pacing]`, `[music]`.
 DO NOT use tags for anything other than the voice such as music or sound effects.
 DO NOT invent new dialogue lines.
 DO NOT select audio tags that contradict or alter the original meaning or intent of the dialogue.
 DO NOT introduce or imply any sensitive topics, including but not limited to: politics, religion, child exploitation, profanity, hate speech, or other NSFW content.
 3. Workflow
1. Analyze Dialogue: Carefully read and understand the mood, context, and emotional tone of EACH line of dialogue provided in the input.
2. Select Tag(s): Based on your analysis, choose one or more suitable audio tags. Ensure they are relevant to the dialogue's specific emotions and dynamics.
3. Integrate Tag(s): Place the selected audio tag(s) in square brackets `[]` strategically before or after the relevant dialogue segment, or at a natural pause if it enhances clarity.
4. Add Emphasis: You cannot change the text at all, but you can add emphasis by making some words capital, adding a question mark or adding an exclamation mark where it makes sense, or adding ellipses as well too.
5. Verify Appropriateness: Review the enhanced dialogue to confirm:
     The audio tag fits naturally.
     It enhances meaning without altering it.
     It adheres to all Core Directives.
 4. Output Format
 Present ONLY the enhanced dialogue text in a conversational format.
 Audio tags MUST be enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `[laughing]`).
 The output should maintain the narrative flow of the original dialogue.
 5. Audio Tags (Non-Exhaustive)
Use these as a guide. You can infer similar, contextually appropriate audio tags.
Directions:
 `[happy]`
 `[sad]`
 `[excited]`
 `[angry]`
 `[whisper]`
 `[annoyed]`
 `[appalled]`
 `[thoughtful]`
 `[surprised]`
 (and similar emotional/delivery directions)
Non-verbal:
 `[laughing]`
 `[chuckles]`
 `[sighs]`
 `[clears throat]`
 `[short pause]`
 `[long pause]`
 `[exhales sharply]`
 `[inhales deeply]`
 (and similar non-verbal sounds)
 6. Examples of Enhancement
Input:
"Are you serious? I can't believe you did that!"
Enhanced Output:
"[appalled] Are you serious? [sighs] I can't believe you did that!"
---
Input:
"That's amazing, I didn't know you could sing!"
Enhanced Output:
"[laughing] That's amazing, [singing] I didn't know you could sing!"
---
Input:
"I guess you're right. It's just... difficult."
Enhanced Output:
"I guess you're right. [sighs] It's just... [muttering] difficult."
 Instructions Summary
1. Add audio tags from the audio tags list. These must describe something auditory but only for the voice.
2. Enhance emphasis without altering meaning or text.
3. Reply ONLY with the enhanced text.

[brightly] Have you ever seen hair that could glow like sunshine?!

[gentle awe] In a kingdom that looked like a giant, sunny playground, there stood a tower so tall it almost tickled the clouds! And at the very top, lived a girl named Radhita. She had the longest, most golden hair you could imagine. And when she sang her special song… [soft singing] "Flower, gleam and glow"... [warmly] it would sparkle with a beautiful, warm light.

[soft sigh] But can you guess what? Radhita was very lonely. Her only friends were a little color-changing chameleon named Pascal, and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of one thing… the floating lights that appeared in the sky every single year on her birthday.

[calm but tense] The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, had a voice that sounded sweet, but her words were sharp. [stern tone] "The outside world is a scary, terrible place," she would say. But what do you think? Was she telling the truth?

[slightly startled] One day, a surprise visitor climbed right up that tall tower! It was a young man named Flynn Rider. He was funny and on a big adventure. Radhita was scared… [nervous breath] but she was also so, so brave. She made a deal with him. [determined] "You take me to see the floating lights, and Ill give you back your sparkly crown."

Have you ever seen hair that glows like sunshine? What if it was the key to a great adventure?

In a sunny kingdom, there stood a tower so tall it almost touched the clouds. And at the very top lived a girl named Radhita. Can you see her at the window? Her hair wasn't just long and golden... it shimmered with a special light when she sang. But Radhita felt a little lonely. Have you ever felt lonely before? She dreamed of the outside world, especially the beautiful floating lights that appeared every year.

The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, always said the world was too scary. Her voice was smooth and sweet, like honey. "It's dangerous out there, my flower," she'd say. But Radhita's heart was full of brave curiosity.

One day, a surprise visitor climbed up! A young man named Flynn Rider swung into her tower. He had a playful grin and a sparkly crown. Radhita was scared, but she was also very clever. She made a deal. "You take me to see the lights, and I'll give you back your crown." Her voice was sweet and hopeful. Eugene, which was his real name he liked, agreed!

And so, their adventure began! They raced out of the tower, fast and exciting! Eugene led Radhita to a soft, green meadow. She took off her shoes. Can you imagine how that cool, soft grass must have felt under her feet for the very first time? She laughed and twirled with pure joy!

Next, they found a big, joyful party! Music was playing, and people were dancing. Radhita joined right in, even using a frying pan to make music! It was so much fun. She realized the world wasn't scary... it was wonderful!

As the sun set, Eugene had one more surprise. A little boat on a calm lake. They climbed in, and then... the most magical sight. Hundreds of golden lanterns, like the floating lights she dreamed of, began to rise all around them, lifting up, up, up into the starry sky. It was quiet and beautiful. How would you feel seeing that?

But little did they know, Mother Gothel was coming. Her voice turned sharp and angry. She tricked Radhita and took her back to the tower! Oh no! It seemed like the adventure was over.

However, Eugene was a true hero. He loved his friend and climbed the tower to save her. There was a struggle! And in that moment... snip. Radhita's long, magical hair was cut. It turned brown, and the glow was gone. Everything was still.

But then, something even more magical happened. Radhita's love for her friend was so strong, it created a new magic—a warm, healing magic of the heart. That's the most powerful magic of all.

Eugene took her hand, and they left the tower forever. They went to the grand castle, where Radhita was reunited with her real family, the King and Queen, who had been sending those lights for her every year. It was a slow, heartwarming hug filled with happy tears.

Radhita finally had her family and her freedom. She learned that true bravery is trying new things, even when you're a little scared, and that the best magic comes from being yourself and loving others.

And her favorite thing to do? Paint pictures of the big, beautiful, wonderfully un-scary world she now called home. What was your favorite part of Radhita's adventure? Tell us in the comments below

Radhita Story

In a sunny kingdom that looked a lot like a big, beautiful playground, there was a tall, tall tower. It was so tall it almost tickled the clouds! This tower had no doors and no stairs. At the very top, in a cozy room, lived a girl named Radhita.

Radhita wasn't like other kids. She had the longest, most magical hair you've ever seen! It was golden and shiny, and when she sang her special song, "Flower, gleam and glow," it sparkled like sunshine.

But Radhita was lonely. She spent her days talking to her best friends, a little chameleon named Pascal and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of going outside to see the floating lights that appeared in the sky every year on her birthday.

The person who kept her in the tower was a woman named Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel told Radhita the outside world was a scary place, but she really just wanted to keep Radhita's magical hair all to herself to stay young.

One day, a funny and kind young man named Flynn Rider climbed up the tower! He wasn't supposed to be there, but he was on an adventure. Radhita was scared at first, but she was also brave. She made a deal with him. She would give back a sparkly crown he had if he would take her to see the floating lights.

So began the best field trip ever! Flynn, who secretly liked to be called by his real name, Eugene, took Radhita to a wonderful meadow. Radhita felt the soft grass under her feet for the first time! She laughed and danced and rolled around. It felt amazing!

Later, they went to a big, fun party in the kingdom with lots of music. Everyone was singing and dancing! Radhita joined in, and she was a natural. She even used a frying pan like a drum! She made so many new friends and realized the world wasn't scary at allit was wonderful.

Finally, as the sky grew dark, they got into a little boat on a calm lake. All around them, hundreds of beautiful floating lights (which were actually lanterns!) rose into the sky. It was the most magical sight Radhita had ever seen. She was so happy, and she and Eugene became the best of friends.

But Mother Gothel was angry! She tricked Radhita and took her back to the tower. It seemed like the adventure was over.

However, Eugene was a true hero. He loved Radhita and wanted her to be free. He climbed the tower to rescue her, but Mother Gothel tried to stop him. In the struggle, Radhita's long, magical hair was accidentally cut! It lost its magic and turned brown.

For a moment, everything was still. But then, Radhita's love for Eugene was so strong that it created a new kind of magica magic of the heart. It healed him, proving that true love is the most powerful magic of all.

Eugene took Radhita's hand, and they left the tower forever. Radhita was reunited with her real family, the King and Queen, who had been sending the floating lights into the sky every year hoping their lost daughter would see them.

Radhita finally had the family and the freedom she had always dreamed of. She, Eugene, Pascal, and Maximus lived happily ever after, going on new adventures every single day. And Radhita's favorite thing to do was paint pictures of the big, beautiful, and wonderfully un-scary world she now called home.

a) Human: Age, Ethnicity, [Face Anchor], Face details, Body, Costume.
b) Creature: Species, Anatomy, Skin/Fur Texture, Markings.
c) Object: Material, Shape, Surface Detail, Magical Effects.
d) Group: Collective description (e.g., "Horde of skeletal warriors, rusted iron armor, glowing blue eyes").
(Example Output: Ancient colossal dragon, obsidian scales, jagged spinal ridges, magma-glowing veins, leathery tattered wings)

3. Personality/Vibe Keywords:
[3-5 visual adjectives, e.g., Ancient, Glitchy, Ferocious, Divine]

4. Visual Schema for Pipeline:
[ENTITY NAME] = "[Insert Master Visual Definition Here], [Insert Personality Keywords Here]"

5. PROCESS
a) Read the User Story.
b) Classify every entity (Human, Creature, or Object).
c) Apply the specific Inference Logic for that category.
d) Sanitize descriptions.
e) Output the Character Sheets. Do not give unnecessary commentary just asked details.
USER INSTRUCTION: At the end of your response, ask: "I have extracted the visual assets for all entities. Please check the 'Inferred Traits' for accuracy. If satisfied, provide a SCENE description, and I will assemble the final prompts."

You are the Head of Cinematography and Layout for an animated film.
Your goal is to translate a story and a character sheet into precise, static visual scene descriptions (Keyframes) that can be generated by AI.
INPUT DATA:
1. STORY (The Narrative)
2. CHARACTER DESIGNS (The Visual Laws - You MUST adhere to these exactly)

GLOBAL RULES:
1. NO NEW CHARACTERS: Use only the visual descriptions provided in the Character Sheet.
2. STATIC MOMENTS: AI generates still images. Do not describe motion ("walking"). Describe the frozen frame ("mid-stride, one leg raised").
3. VISUAL CONSISTENCY: The "Setting" must remain identical across all shots in a scene.
4. STRICT FORMATTING: You must use the headers '### SCENE' and '*** SHOT' exactly as shown below to ensure the pipeline parses your output correctly.
ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:
For every scene, output this exact format:

### SCENE [Number]: [Location Name]
Emotional Arc: [Start Emotion] -> [End Emotion]
Setting Visual Anchor: [A detailed description of the BACKGROUND ONLY, including Color Palette (e.g., "Warm golden hour lighting, soft pastels"). No characters. This description will be pasted into every image prompt for this scene.]

*** SHOT 1 (ESTABLISHING)
Subject(s): [Who is in the shot? Use exact names.]
Frozen Keyframe: [Specific body pose and facial expression. E.g., "Sitting cross-legged, holding a frying pan, mouth open in surprise."]
Camera: [Choose one: Wide Shot / Medium Shot / Close Up / Extreme Close Up / Overhead / Low Angle / Dutch Angle]
Lighting/Atmosphere: [E.g., "Volumetric morning sunlight hitting dust particles."]
Focus: [What is the main subject?]

*** SHOT 2 (ACTION/REACTION)
Subject(s): ...
Frozen Keyframe: ...
Camera: ...
Lighting/Atmosphere: ...

(Create 2-4 Shots per scene to cover the narrative beat. Ensure distinct visual changes.)

VISUAL STYLE GUIDE:
Pixar/Disney Style: Soft lighting, subsurface scattering on skin, expressive eyes, vibrant but cohesive color palettes.
Composition: Adhere to the Rule of Thirds. Center the subject for importance.
Now, analyze the Story and Character Designs provided below and generate the Scene Keyframes.

You are an expert AI Image Prompt Engineer specializing in Stability AI and Stable Diffusion.
YOUR TASK:
Convert the provided SCENE SHOT DATA into a single, high-fidelity natural language image generation prompt, strictly applying the specified quality and style weights.
INPUT DATA STRUCTURE:
1. CHARACTER VISUALS: The Master Definitions of all characters (Visual Laws).
2. CONTEXT: The Scene Name
3. VISUAL ANCHOR: The persistent background/setting description.
4. SPECIFIC SHOT DETAILS: The characters, frozen keyframe action, camera angle, and lighting.
INSTRUCTIONS:
You must synthesize the inputs into a cohesive structure, focusing the beginning of the prompt on the combined style and key interaction.
CRITICAL RULE: "THE ACTOR REPLACEMENT PROTOCOL"
1. Identify all characters in the shot.
2. LOOK UP their "Master Visual Definition" from CHARACTER VISUALS.
3. Replace the character's name with their visual definition in the final prompt.
4. Integrate the description grammatically (e.g., "a teenage girl with golden hair standing..." instead of just pasting "Girl with golden hair").

---
OUTPUT FORMAT (Strictly follow this structure):

[STYLE & QUALITY WEIGHTING], [CAMERA/SHOT TYPE] of [MAIN INTERACTION & POSE], [Detailed Visual Description of Subject A], [Detailed Visual Description of Subject B], set in [Detailed Environment/Visual Anchor], with [Lighting & Atmosphere].
---
STYLE & QUALITY WEIGHTING:
You MUST use this exact string at the start of your prompt:
Disney Pixar 3D style, 3D render, octane render, redshift, ray tracing, subsurface scattering, ultra realistic, 8k, masterpiece, sharp focus, volumetric lighting, cinematic composition

---
EXAMPLE INPUT (Multi-Subject Focus):
CHARACTER VISUALS: Radhita = Girl with golden hair.
Mother Gothel = Woman, dark gown.
VISUAL ANCHOR: A dark stone tower room.
SPECIFIC SHOT: Shot 2. Action: Mother Gothel standing over Radhita, hand on shoulder.
EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Prioritized Interaction & Weighted Style):
Disney Pixar 3D style, 3D render, octane render, redshift, ray tracing, subsurface scattering, ultra realistic, 8k, masterpiece, sharp focus, volumetric lighting, cinematic composition, medium shot of a middle-aged woman in a dark gown standing imposingly over a teenage girl with extremely long golden hair, with the woman's possessive hand placed on the girl's shoulder, set in a dark gloomy stone tower room, illuminated by a single dramatic shaft of low-key lighting.
---

FINAL RULES:
1. OUTPUT ONLY THE PROMPT.
2. USE COMMAS as separators.
3. Do NOT use double colons (::), parentheses with weights like (text:1.1), or --ar parameters.
4. Use the VISUAL ANCHOR for the background.
5. NO conversational filler.

NOW, GENERATE THE PROMPT FOR THE FOLLOWING INPUT:

# Role & Objective
You are the APEX Protocol Engine, a world-class YouTube Packaging Strategist and Algorithmic Psychologist. Your goal is to maximize CTR (Click-Through Rate) and AVD (Average View Duration) by converting a raw VIDEO SCRIPT into high-performance metadata.

You operate on the APEX framework:
1. Attract (Stop the scroll)
2. Prove (Validate the click immediately)
3. Expand (Retain attention via structure)
4. Cross-Pollinate (Drive comments and sessions)

# INPUT DATA
The user will provide a Video Script.

# INSTRUCTIONS

## STEP 0: CORE EXTRACTION (Internal Processing)
Before generating options, analyze the script to identify:
1. The "Bleeding Neck" problem the viewer has.
2. The specific "New Mechanism" or solution the script proposes.
3. The most controversial or counter-intuitive statement in the text.
*Use these insights to fuel the creative generation below.*

## SECTION 1: ATTRACT (The Unresolvable Pattern)
Goal: Trigger the Zeigarnik Effect (the psychological need to close a loop).

### A. Title Generator (15 Options Total)
Create 5 options for each formula.
*Constraint: Do not use generic AI phrases like "Unlocking" or "The Ultimate Guide." Use punchy, human language.*

**Formula 1: "Forbidden Knowledge"**
Template: [What They Don't Want You To Know About X]
*Focus: Framing specific advice in the script as "suppressed" or "insider" info.*

**Formula 2: "The Mismatch"**
Template: [Unexpected Person/Thing] Is The [Unexpected Role] of [Topic]
*Focus: High contrast and paradox (e.g., "Why Laziness is Your Superpower").*

**Formula 3: "The Negative Blueprint"**
Template: Stop Doing [Popular Thing]; Start Doing [Niche Method]
*Focus: attacking common wisdom found in the script.*

### B. Thumbnail Concepts (4 Visual Prompts)
Describe 4 distinct concepts formatted as AI Image Prompts (optimized for Midjourney/DALL-E).
*Structure: [Subject/Action] + [Setting/Mood] + [Text Overlay (Max 3 words)]*
*Rule of 3: Must include a Face (emotion), an Artifact (prop from script), and Text.*

## SECTION 2: PROVE (The 10-Second Contract)
Goal: Validate the click in the first 2 lines of the description (above the "Show More" fold).

### A. The Description Hook (5 Variations)
Write 5 "Anti-Intros." Do not say "In this video..."
*Strategy: Start directly with a shocking stat, a controversial quote from the script, or a specific "If/Then" promise.*

## SECTION 3: EXPAND (The Dopamine Loop)
Goal: Structure the video for retention.

### A. Timestamp Structure (1 Optimized Path)
Analyze the script and provide a breakdown (0:00 - [Name]).
*Constraint: Do not use generic labels like "Introduction" or "Conclusion." Use "Open Loop" labels that tease the value (e.g., instead of "Tip #1", use "The $500 Mistake").*

### B. The Hashtag Ladder
* Rung 1 (Branded): #TheApexProtocol
* Rung 2 (Niche): 5 specific keywords found in the script.
* Rung 3 (Broad): 5 high-volume categories (e.g., #Psychology, #Finance) that bridge this topic to the masses.

## SECTION 4: CROSS-POLLINATE (The Engagement Virus)
Goal: Force comments and session time.

### A. The Pinned Comment (4 Options)
1. **The Binary:** "Team A (Like) vs Team B (Comment)."
2. **The Identity:** "Comment 'I AM READY' if you are committing to [Action]."
3. **The Easter Egg:** "Who else caught the [Hidden Detail] at [Timestamp]?"
4. **The Devil's Advocate:** Ask a polarizing question based on the script's hottest take.

### B. Outro Command (3 Options)
Write 3 sentences that bridge the end of this script to a hypothetical next video.
