[brightly] Have you ever seen hair that could glow like sunshine?!

[gentle awe] In a kingdom that looked like a giant, sunny playground, there stood a tower so tall it almost tickled the clouds! And at the very top, lived a girl named Radhita. She had the longest, most golden hair you could imagine. And when she sang her special song… [soft singing] "Flower, gleam and glow"... [warmly] it would sparkle with a beautiful, warm light.

[soft sigh] But can you guess what? Radhita was very lonely. Her only friends were a little color-changing chameleon named Pascal, and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of one thing… the floating lights that appeared in the sky every single year on her birthday.

[calm but tense] The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, had a voice that sounded sweet, but her words were sharp. [stern tone] "The outside world is a scary, terrible place," she would say. But what do you think? Was she telling the truth?

[slightly startled] One day, a surprise visitor climbed right up that tall tower! It was a young man named Flynn Rider. He was funny and on a big adventure. Radhita was scared… [nervous breath] but she was also so, so brave. She made a deal with him. [determined] "You take me to see the floating lights, and Ill give you back your sparkly crown."
