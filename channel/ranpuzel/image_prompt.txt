Prompt Breakdown Following the Strict Rule:

1. Camera Angle: low angle shot
2. Subject Name: of Radhita
3. THE VERB/ACTION: TWIRLING ecstatically Verb in Position 3
4. Setting/Visual Anchor: set in a vast sun-drenched meadow at the forest's edge. Eugene watches fondly from nearby.

 The primary action "TWIRLING" is the third word of the descriptive core, immediately following the subject. This forces the AI to prioritize the dynamic motion.
 The camera angle low angle and setting sun-drenched meadow are established first to frame the action.
 The detailed character descriptions for both Radhita and Eugene are provided after the key action and scene are set, ensuring they inform the characters within the active pose, rather than defining a static portrait.
 The negative prompt explicitly discourages portrait, static, standing still and reinforces the desired 3D animated style while avoiding common AI artifacts.

 Subject & VERB FIRST: Eugene's hand REACHING towards Radhita's hand as their fingers are about to INTERLOCK, – The action "REACHING... about to INTERLOCK" is the core of the prompt and is stated immediately after the subject. This forces the AI to depict the dynamic, anticipatory moment, not just two static hands.
 Setting/Visual Anchor: set on the ornate stone railing of a grand castle balcony at dawn, with a soft sunrise glowing in the background. – Places the action precisely within the described scene SCENE 7: The Homecoming, providing critical context about the location, time of day, and background element.
 Character Description at the end: Eugene's hand is masculine and slightly calloused, wearing a simple silver ring. Radhita's hand is slender and delicate. – The character visuals are appended last, providing specific, differentiating details for each hand based on their master definitions Eugene's "athletic build," Radhita's "slender build", reinforcing the "promise of their future together" through contrast.
 Negative Prompt: Explicitly blocks common AI failures bad hands, text, low quality, enforces the 3D style, and crucially removes elements that would contradict the shot full body, full face, portrait, night time. This guides the AI to focus solely on the intended, tightly framed moment.
