FLOWING PARAGRAPH PROMPT:
A medium shot in semirealistic fantasy digital art, capturing the moment a young man, now healed, opens his eyes and smiles softly at the young woman cradling him in a tower room. A warm, golden light spreads from their connection, pushing back the cold shadows and filling the room with a serene, ethereal atmosphere. Their expressions are loving, relieved, and hopeful, their eyes bright and locked on each other. The lighting is soft, diffused, and dramatic volumetric golden glow that emanates from their love, creating a warm, analogous color palette of golds and yellows that evokes a powerful sense of hope. The composition uses the rule of thirds with a sharp focus on their emotional connection, enhanced by a subtle depth of field and lens flare. Rendered in 4K as a professional masterpiece with ray tracing and global illumination, avoiding any anatomical errors or text.
