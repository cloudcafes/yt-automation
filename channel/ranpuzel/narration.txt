NARRATION TEXT

Have you ever seen a tower so tall, it could tickle the clouds?

At the very top, in a room with no doors, lived a girl named Radhita. She had the longest, most magical hair, shining like gold. When she sang her special song… "Flower, gleam and glow"... it sparkled with the power of sunshine itself.

But Radhita was lonely. Her only friends were a tiny chameleon and a brave horse. She dreamed of the outside world, especially the mysterious floating lights that appeared every year. Can you imagine never leaving your room?

The woman who kept her there, Mother Gothel, said the world was a scary, dangerous place. But was it?

One day, a surprise visitor climbed up! A young man named Flynn Rider, on the run from the royal guards. Radhita was scared… but she was also brave. She made a deal: her hair’s magic for a crown, and a trip to see those lights!

And so, the adventure began! Flynn, who secretly liked his real name, Eugene, took her to a sun-drenched meadow. For the very first time, Radhita felt soft, cool grass beneath her feet. She laughed and spun and danced! The world wasn’t scary… it was wonderful!

Next, a kingdom party! Music filled the air. Radhita joined the fun, even drumming on a frying pan! She made so many friends. Have you ever felt that happy, dancing with new friends?

Then, as night fell, they climbed into a little boat on a quiet lake. And then… it happened. Hundreds of golden lights floated up, up, up into the starry sky. They weren't just lights—they were lanterns! It was more magical than Radhita had ever dreamed.

But little did they know… Mother Gothel was watching. She tricked Radhita and brought her back to the tower. It seemed the adventure was over.

However, Eugene was a true hero. He raced to the tower to save his friend. In a struggle, something shocking happened—Radhita’s long, magical hair was cut! It turned brown, and all its sparkle was gone.

For a moment, all hope seemed lost. But then, something new sparked. Radhita’s love for Eugene was so strong, it created a new magic—the magic of a true heart. It healed him, proving that real love is the most powerful magic of all.

Eugene took Radhita’s hand, and they left the tower forever. And the most wonderful surprise was waiting… the King and Queen were her real parents! Those floating lights were for her all along.

Radhita finally had her family, her freedom, and her best friends. They lived happily ever after, exploring the big, beautiful, and wonderfully un-scary world. And Radhita’s favorite thing? Painting pictures of all the amazing places she could now call home.
