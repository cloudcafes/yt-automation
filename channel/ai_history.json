    "response": "### SCENE 1: The Tower Room\nEmotional Arc: Lonely - Hopeful\nSetting Visual Anchor: A circular stone room at the top of a tall tower. The walls are covered in colorful, naive paintings of the outside world. A single large window with a stone sill overlooks a distant kingdom. Warm, volumetric afternoon sunlight streams in, illuminating dust motes. Color Palette: Warm stone grays, soft lavender and gold from the light, pops of color from the paintings.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Radhita\nFrozen Keyframe: Sitting on the stone window sill, one knee drawn up to her chest. Her chin rests on her knee as she gazes longingly out the window. Her long golden hair cascades down her back and over the sill.\nCamera: Medium Shot from the side, showing her profile and the view outside\nLighting/Atmosphere: The warm sunlight highlights her hair and side of her face, creating a soft glow. The rest of the room is in softer shadow.\nFocus: Radhita's wistful expression and the contrast between her colorful room and the vast world outside.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Mother Gothel, Radhita\nFrozen Keyframe: Mother Gothel stands behind Radhita, placing a seemingly comforting hand on her shoulder.

He looks up with a surprised and charming smirk. Radhita stands frozen a few feet away, holding a heavy book like a shield, her eyes wide with alarm.\nCamera: Wide Shot to show the entire room and the dynamic between them\nLighting/Atmosphere: Strong, directional golden-hour light from the window, creating long shadows. Dust is still swirling in the air from his entrance.\nFocus: The sudden intrusion and the standoff between the two characters.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita, Eugene, The Crown\nFrozen Keyframe: Radhita now holds the sparkling crown in one hand, slightly behind her back. She stands straighter, with a clever, negotiating look on her face. Eugene is standing now, hands slightly raised in a \"fair enough\" gesture, his playful grin wider.\nCamera: Medium Shot centered on Radhita, Eugene in the foreground slightly out of focus\nLighting/Atmosphere: The light catches the facets of the crown, making it sparkle. Radhita's face is lit with newfound determination.\nFocus: Radhita holding the crown and the shift in power in the negotiation.\n\n### SCENE 3: First Taste of Freedom The Meadow\nEmotional Arc: Overwhelmed - Pure Joy\nSetting Visual Anchor: A vast, sun-drenched meadow at the edge of a forest. Lush green grass dotted with wildflowers daisies, poppies. A clear blue sky with puffy white clouds. Color Palette: Vibrant greens, bright blues, pops of flower colors red, white, yellow.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Radhita, Eugene\nFrozen Keyframe: Radhita is mid-twirl, her arms outstretched, her lavender dress and golden hair fanning out around her.

Eugene watches from a few yards away, leaning against a tree with a fond, warm smile.\nCamera: Low Angle looking up at Radhita as she twirls, sky in background\nLighting/Atmosphere: Bright, cheerful midday sun. Soft subsurface scattering on skin. The light makes the green grass and her hair glow.\nFocus: Radhita's unbridled joy and physical freedom.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita's feet, blades of grass\nFrozen Keyframe: A close-up of Radhita's bare feet planted firmly in the deep grass. Several blades of cool, green grass are curled between her toes. Her feet are slightly dirty from the earth.\nCamera: Extreme Close Up\nLighting/Atmosphere: Dappled sunlight and soft shadow on the grass and skin.\nFocus: The intimate sensory detail of connecting with nature for the first time.\n\n### SCENE 4: The Village Celebration\nEmotional Arc: Nervous - Joyfully Accepted\nSetting Visual Anchor: A rustic village square at dusk. Wooden stalls, strings of simple paper lanterns just beginning to glow. The stone ground is worn smooth. Buildings with timber frames are in the background. Color Palette: Warm earth tones browns, oranges, golden lantern light, colorful clothing from the party people.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Radhita, The Party People, The Frying Pan\nFrozen Keyframe: Radhita is in the middle of the square, holding the frying pan like a drum. She is mid-strike, hitting it with a wooden spoon, a look of delighted concentration on her face. Around her, Party People are frozen in mid-dance, clapping, and laughing.\nCamera: Wide Shot high angle, slightly overhead to capture the whole festive scene\nLighting/Atmosphere: The warm, low glow of lanterns creates a cozy, festive atmosphere. Long shadows.\nFocus: Radhita as the cheerful center of the celebration, fully participating.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita, Eugene\nFrozen Keyframe: Eugene offers his hand to Radhita for a dance. She is looking at his hand, then up at his face, with a smile of happy disbelief and trust. The frying pan rests at her feet.\nCamera: Medium Close Up on their hands and faces\nLighting/Atmosphere: A nearby lantern highlights their faces and hands, creating a warm, intimate pocket of light.\nFocus: The connection and invitation between them.\n\n### SCENE 5: The Lantern Lake\nEmotional Arc: Awe - Peaceful Wonder\nSetting Visual Anchor: A perfectly calm, dark lake reflecting a starry night sky and a crescent moon. The water is like black glass. The far shore is a silhouette of pine trees. Color Palette: Deep blues and blacks, silver starlight, the warm gold of the lanterns.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Radhita, Eugene, The Lanterns\nFrozen Keyframe: Radhita and Eugene are sitting side-by-side in a small wooden rowboat. They are looking up and around, mouths slightly agape in awe. Hundreds of golden lanterns fill the air around and above them, reflecting perfectly in the still water below.\nCamera: Wide Shot from a low angle on the water, capturing the boat, the characters, and the vast sea of lanterns\nLighting/Atmosphere: The lanterns are the only light source, casting a warm, magical, ethereal glow on their faces and the boat.\nFocus: The scale of the lantern spectacle and their shared wonder.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita\nFrozen Keyframe: A single tear of joy traces a path down Radhita's cheek as she looks at a lantern held gently in her own hands, her expression one of profound happiness and fulfillment.\nCamera: Extreme Close Up on her face and the lantern in her hands\nLighting/Atmosphere: The soft, warm light from the lantern in her hands illuminates her face from below.\nFocus: The emotional payoff and realization of her dream.\n\n### SCENE 6: The Final Confrontation\nEmotional Arc: Despair - Magical Resolution\nSetting Visual Anchor: The tower room again, now at night. The room is dark, lit only by cold moonlight from the window and the fading glow of Radhita's hair. It feels chaotic, with a chair overturned. Color Palette: Cool blues, silvers, and the dying gold of the hair glow.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Mother Gothel, Radhita\nFrozen Keyframe: Mother Gothel has a firm grip on Radhita's wrist, pulling her away from the window. Her elegant face is twisted in anger and desperation. Radhita is struggling, reaching back towards the window with her free hand, her expression fearful and determined.\nCamera: Dutch Angle to increase tension and instability\nLighting/Atmosphere: Harsh moonlight creates sharp contrasts and deep shadows. The glow from Radhita's hair is flickering.\nFocus: The struggle and the shift in Mother Gothel's true nature.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita, Eugene\nFrozen Keyframe: The moment after the hair is cut. Radhita's now-short brown hair is splayed out around her head as she kneels on the floor, cradling Eugene's head in her lap. One of her tears is frozen in mid-air as it falls towards his cheek. A soft, warm, golden light—different from her hair's glow—emanates from their point of contact.\nCamera: Close Up low angle, looking up at Radhita's face and the falling tear\nLighting/Atmosphere: The cold moonlight is being overtaken by the new, warm, magical light of love from the healing act.\nFocus: The transformative moment of sacrifice and the birth of the new \"heart magic.\"\n\n### SCENE 7: The Homecoming\nEmotional Arc: Nervous Hope - Overwhelming Love\nSetting Visual Anchor: A grand castle balcony at dawn. Ornate stone railings, majestic purple and blue banners with crests. The sky is painted with soft pink, orange, and purple hues. Color Palette: Dawn pastels pink, peach, lavender, rich royal blues and purples, warm gold from the rising sun.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: The King and Queen, Radhita, Eugene\nFrozen Keyframe: The King and Queen are kneeling, their arms wrapped tightly around Radhita in a tearful group hug. The Queen's face is buried in Radhita's shoulder, the King's eyes are tightly shut with emotion. Radhita's eyes are closed, a serene smile on her face as she hugs them back. Eugene stands a respectful step back, watching with a soft, happy smile.\nCamera: Wide Shot capturing the full emotional scene and the beautiful dawn sky\nLighting/Atmosphere: The warm, gentle light of dawn washes over the scene, creating a heavenly, heartwarming glow.\nFocus: The long-awaited reunion and the formation of the new family unit.\n\n SHOT 2 ACTION/REACTION\nSubjects: Radhita's hand, Eugene's hand\nFrozen Keyframe: Eugene's hand is reaching into the frame. Radhita's hand is reaching up to meet it, their fingers about to intertwine. In the background, out of focus, is the bright, open balcony and the sunrise.\nCamera: Close Up on the hands\nLighting/Atmosphere: The dawn light gilds the edges of their hands.\nFocus: The promise of their future together, starting now."

This forces the AI to prioritize the dynamic motion.\n The camera angle low angle and setting sun-drenched meadow are established first to frame the action.\n The detailed character descriptions for both Radhita and Eugene are provided after the key action and scene are set, ensuring they inform the characters within the active pose, rather than defining a static portrait.\n The negative prompt explicitly discourages portrait, static, standing still and reinforces the desired 3D animated style while avoiding common AI artifacts."

    "response": "Audio Hook - Warm, Magical Voice\n\"Have you ever seen hair that glows like sunshine?\"\n\nVisual: Close-up of Radhita’s hair shimmering with golden light.\n\nIn a kingdom as bright and cheerful as a playground, there was a tower. A tower so tall, it seemed to whisper secrets to the clouds. And at the very top, lived a girl named Radhita.\n\nRadhita had a wonderful secret. Her long, golden hair didn't just shine... it sparkled with magic when she sang. Can you imagine that?\n\nBut, friends, Radhita felt a lonely feeling in her heart. She dreamed of the outside world, especially the mysterious floating lights that appeared every year. The woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, always said in a smooth, sweet voice, \"The world is a scary, dangerous place, my flower.\" But what do you think? Was she telling the truth?\n\nOne day, a surprise visitor climbed up! A young man named Flynn Rider, with a playful grin and a sparkly crown. Radhita was scared, but she was also very brave. She made a deal. \"You take me to see the lights, and I'll give back your crown.\" And so, their adventure began!\n\nPace: Fast & Excited\nFirst, Eugene—that was his real name he liked—took her to a meadow. Radhita felt the soft, tickly grass under her feet for the very first time! She laughed and twirled. The world wasn't scary... it was wonderful!\n\nThen, they found a village party! Music was playing, and people were dancing. Clang! Clang! What was that sound? It was Radhita, using a frying pan as a drum! She made so many new friends.\n\nPace: Slow & Gentle\nAs the sky turned dark, something magical happened. Eugene and Radhita floated on a quiet lake. And then... hundreds of golden lanterns, like floating stars, began to rise all around them. It was the most beautiful sight. Radhita’s heart was full of a happy, joyful feeling.\n\nBut little did they know, Mother Gothel was watching. Her voice turned sharp and angry. She tricked Radhita and took her back to the tower! Oh no! It seemed like the adventure was over.\n\nPace: Medium & Suspenseful\nBut Eugene was a true friend. He loved Radhita and wanted her to be free. He raced back to the tall tower to rescue her. There was a struggle! And in that moment... snip. Radhita's long, magical hair was cut. The gold faded to brown. The magic was gone.\n\nFor a second, everything was still and quiet. But then, something even more powerful happened. Radhita’s love for her friend created a new magic—a magic of the heart. It healed Eugene! It showed that true love and kindness are the strongest magic of all.\n\nPace: Slow & Heartwarming\nEugene took Radhita's hand, and they left the tower forever.

Shadows are deep and dramatic.\n\n SHOT 1 ESTABLISHING\nSubjects: Mother Gothel, Radhita\nFrozen Keyframe: Mother Gothel has a firm grip on Radhita's arm.
