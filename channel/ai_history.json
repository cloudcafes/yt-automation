    "response": "Warm, magical Disney-style narrator voice begins\n\nHave you ever seen hair that could glow like sunshine? ✨\n\nIn a kingdom that looked like a giant, sunny playground, there stood a tower so tall it almost tickled the clouds! And at the very top, lived a girl named Radhita. She had the longest, most golden hair you could imagine. And when she sang her special song… \"Flower, gleam and glow\"... it would sparkle with a beautiful, warm light.\n\nBut can you guess what? Radhita was very lonely. Her only friends were a little color-changing chameleon named Pascal, and a brave horse named Maximus. She dreamed of one thing… the floating lights that appeared in the sky every single year on her birthday.\n\nThe woman who lived with her, Mother Gothel, had a voice that sounded sweet, but her words were sharp. \"The outside world is a scary, terrible place,\" she would say. But what do you think? Was she telling the truth?\n\nOne day, a surprise visitor climbed right up that tall tower! It was a young man named Flynn Rider. He was funny and on a big adventure. Radhita was scared… but she was also so, so brave. She made a deal with him. \"You take me to see the floating lights, and I'll give you back your sparkly crown.\"\n\nAnd so… their amazing adventure began!\n\nEugene—that was Flynn's real name, a secret he shared—took her to a wonderful, open meadow. For the very first time, Radhita felt the soft, tickly grass under her feet. She laughed and danced and twirled. What would it feel like to touch grass for the very first time?\n\nLater, they found a big, joyful party! The sound of happy music filled the air. Everyone was singing and dancing. Radhita joined right in, even using a frying pan to bang along with the beat! She realized the world wasn't scary at all. It was full of wonderful, new friends.\n\nAs the sun began to set, something magical happened. Eugene led her to a little boat on a calm, dark lake. And then… they began to rise. Hundreds… no, thousands of golden floating lights filled the sky all around them. It was the most beautiful sight Radhita had ever seen. Her heart felt so full.\n\nBut little did they know, Mother Gothel was watching. She tricked Radhita and took her back to the lonely tower. It seemed like all the magic was gone.\n\nHowever, Eugene’s heart was true and brave. He loved Radhita and wanted her to be free. He climbed the tower to save her! There was a struggle, and in a moment of suspense… snip! Radhita’s long, magical hair was cut. It turned brown and the glow faded away.\n\nFor a moment, everything was still and quiet. But then, something even more magical happened. Radhita’s love for Eugene was so powerful, it created a new magic—a magic of the heart. A single, happy tear fell from her eye… and it healed him! It proved that true love is the most powerful magic of all.\n\nHe took her hand, and they left that tower forever. And on a grand, sunlit balcony, Radhita was finally reunited with her real family, the King and Queen. They had been sending those lights into the sky every year, hoping their lost daughter would find her way home.\n\nRadhita finally had the family and the freedom she had always dreamed of. She, Eugene, Pascal, and Maximus lived happily ever after, exploring their wonderfully un-scary world.\n\nSo remember, being brave can lead you to wonderful new places. And the most powerful magic of all… is true love.\n\nWhat was your favorite magical moment? Was it the glowing hair, the floating lights, or the happy family hug? Let us know in the comments!"
