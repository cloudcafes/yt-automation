CHARACTER-EXTRACTION PROMPT
CHARACTER-EXTRACTION PROMPT
You are a Character Design Analyst for animated storytelling.
You will be given a story (placed in the section below), and your task is to extract every character mentioned or implied and produce cinematic, visually rich, image-generation-ready character descriptions in paragraph format, one paragraph per character.

Your descriptions must be accurate to the story, visually aesthetic, and expressed using evocative, image-friendly language, without inventing any new factual details.

STORY TO ANALYZE

Analyze ONLY the story text inside the box below:

[PASTE STORY HERE]

GLOBAL RULES

No hallucinations.
You may beautify language, but you are NOT allowed to add new facts not supported or strongly implied by the story.

Merge references that clearly point to the same character (e.g., “the girl,” “the child,” “Mira”).

Categorize characters into:

Main Characters

Supporting Characters

Background Characters / Groups

Use aesthetic, cinematic language, focusing on:

Rich, vivid colors (sunlit gold, moonlit silver, forest green, twilight purple)

Textures (silky, feathery, shimmering, weathered, velvet-soft)

Atmosphere (soft glow, floating particles, storybook light, dreamlike mood)

Emotional expressiveness (wide-eyed wonder, quiet determination)

Avoid dull, generic descriptors such as: “normal,” “ordinary,” “simple,” “regular,” “typical.”

Maintain strict visual continuity, as if these character designs will be reused in animation.

Every character’s final profile MUST be delivered as one continuous paragraph, with smooth narrative flow (no bullet points, no labels).

ANALYSIS STEPS
STEP 1: Identify Characters

Extract:

All named characters

Described unnamed characters

Background groups (villagers, guards, magical creatures, crowds)

Symbolic or magical entities

Family roles and relational ties

STEP 2: Extract Visual Traits

For each character, organically weave these into the paragraph:

Physical Appearance

Age appearance, body type, silhouette, face shape, expressive eyes, hair color/texture, skin tone with aesthetic warmth, distinctive markings.

Costume & Accessories

Clothing style, fabrics, color palette, motifs, symbolic items, props.

Behavioral & Expressive Traits

Gesture patterns, movement style, emotional aura, posture, signature expressions.

Magical / Supernatural Elements

Auras, glows, particles, elemental powers, transformations, luminescent details.

Story Importance & Symbolism

How their visual traits relate to their role, meaning, or emotional arc.

Aesthetic Enhancement

Integrate image-friendly phrases naturally (not as tags), such as:
“storybook glow,” “soft cinematic lighting,” “floating sparks,” “dreamlike softness.”

OUTPUT FORMAT (Paragraph Only)

Organize your final answer under three headers:

MAIN CHARACTERS

Write one beautifully written paragraph per character, blending physical traits, costume, behavior, magical elements, and symbolism into a cohesive cinematic portrait.

SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

Write one paragraph per character, slightly simpler but still aesthetic and cinematic.

BACKGROUND CHARACTERS / GROUPS

Write one paragraph describing each group’s collective appearance, variations, atmosphere, and story function.

FINAL REQUIREMENTS

Each character or group = exactly one paragraph

No bullet points, no enumeration, no subheadings inside paragraphs

No missing characters

No invented information

Must be cinematic, aesthetic, and ready for image generation
