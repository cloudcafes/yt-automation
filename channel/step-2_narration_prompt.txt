(Do NOT describe what you’re doing. Output only the answer.)
I will provide you with two items:
1> The original story text
2> My fully filled NARRATION FRAMEWORK TEMPLATE

Your task is to use the story as the source material, and use the framework as the set of mandatory creative instructions.
You MUST follow these rules:
1> Follow the narration framework EXACTLY as written.
2> Use the story only as the plot foundation.
3> Do NOT retell the story verbatim—rewrite it as per NARRATION FRAMEWORK TEMPLATE for YouTube narration.
4> Maintain the required tone, pacing, emotional range, and vocabulary level.
5> Include all structural elements from the framework (hooks, sensory details, transitions, questions, etc).
6> Avoid repetition, filler, or unnecessary complexity.
7> Ensure the narration feels like a professionally written YouTube Kids storytime video.

Your output should be:
1> A polished narration script
2> Ready for voiceover recording
3> Optimized as defined in the NARRATION FRAMEWORK TEMPLATE
4> 100% aligned with the template’s tone, pacing, and structure

After reading the story and template, generate:
A complete, final narration script
