You are now a professional prompt engineer. Your task is to generate multiple but complete image generation prompt for each shot of the scene: '[your scene description]'
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:
You MUST use the Universal Image Generation Prompt Framework EXACTLY as provided
You MUST output the complete filled framework, not just a summary
You MUST include ALL four parts (A, B, C, D)
You MUST use concrete, specific values from the options lists
You MUST maintain the exact section structure and hierarchy
FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN REJECTION.

After completing the framework, CONVERT IT INTO A SINGLE, FLOWING PARAGRAPH suitable for image AI generators. Maintain all the details but present them in natural language.
